# Reversi Game

The same as my [Othello](https://github.com/FarukErat/Othello) repository with a few differences.<br>
This one is written in Python and has GUI, whereas the other one is written in C++ and does not have GUI.<br>
The other one has a 4th game mode option, which is load and save games to files.<br>
The names are different. If I am not mistaken, Othello Game has some trouble with copyright stuff. Hence, I am using reversi as the name now.
